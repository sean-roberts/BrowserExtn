## OneExtension Goal

Browser extensions are great for adding quick services and functionality to
users and websites. Developing these extensions takes a lot of knowledge on
browser proprietary apis. Imagine being a company who wants to build extensions
for all major browsers and wants to add more extensions as there product
portfolio grows. To do that now, you would need a few developers specialized on
how to write extensions cross platform. I believe that we can save a lot of
developer headache and time by offloading these browser differences and quirks
to a framework. That is the goal of this project.
